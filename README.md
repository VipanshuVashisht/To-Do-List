# To-Do List Application

## Description

This project implements a To-Do List application using React. It consists of three main components: `TodoForm`, `TodoItem`, and `TodoContext`. The `TodoForm` component allows users to add new to-do items, the `TodoItem` component displays individual to-do items with options to edit, mark as completed, or delete them, and the `TodoContext` component provides a context for managing to-do items across the application.

## Components

### 1. TodoForm

The `TodoForm` component enables users to add new to-do items to the list. It includes an input field for entering the task and a button to submit the task.

### 2. TodoItem

The `TodoItem` component displays individual to-do items. Each item includes a checkbox for marking the task as completed, a text input field for editing the task, and buttons for editing, deleting, or marking the task as completed.

### 3. TodoContext

The `TodoContext` component provides a context for managing to-do items. It includes methods for adding, updating, deleting, and toggling the completion status of to-do items. The context is used to share state and functionality across components.
